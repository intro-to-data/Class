## Collect It Yourself!

### Status Update

- Have we started data collection?
- Do we have a viable data submission/management system?
- Are we being consistent in how we ask the questions, etc?
- Concerns from anyone in the class?



# Workflow Basics

<div style="float:right; text-align:center; width:49%">

## Scripts

- **Console/REPL v Script:** What is the difference?


## Projects (1)

- What is a R Project?
- What is the R Working Directory?
- How are they the same/different?

<span style="color:red"><b>Hint:</b> This next part is going to be important 
for this week's lab.</span>

## Settings

- To make your scripts reproducible, you should not save state from session to 
  session.
- In a formal research setting, why would this be important?
- RStudio will open to your last project, but your session state will be clean.

## Projects (2)

### Where Are You?

- Go to `Session`, `Restart R`
- In the Console, run `getwd()` and `dir()`.
- Go to that folder with the file browser.
  - Are the contents of this folder consistent with what R showed you?
- Note: RStudio tells you this info in the GUI:

<div style="float:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; text-align:center; width:50%">

</div>

### Prove It:

- Go to [xkcd.com](https://www.xkcd.com) in your browser.
- Find the path to today's comic.
- Download this file, using `download.file()`.
- Can you now see this file in your file browser?

## Current Working Directory (CWD) v Project

- You can set the CWD to be ANYTHING.
- I recommend: 
   - Create a project-specific folder.
   - Then eiter manuall change R's CWD or create a project.
   - To the extent you have variables which have paths to files, you want them 
   relative the a project-specific file folder so others can also run your code.
- This idea of relative versus absolute paths is often confusing to new 
programmers.
- Which is why we are going to do a demo.

## Demo "Project" (1)

- Create a new project called `I Told You So`
  - We can use RStudio to create this new folder.
- You should have a completely blank session.
- Enter/run the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(mpg) # You should have 234 rows of data in mpg
write_csv(x = mpg, path = "all_mpg.csv")

# This will reduce mpg to the first 6 rows.
data(mpg) <- head(mpg)
dim(mpg)
```

- Now, close Rstudio.
- Put the .R file I sent you into this folder.

## Demo "Project" (1)

- Re-open RStudio.
- You should have NOTHING in your Golobal Environment.
- Run `ls()`, `getwd()`, `dir()`
- After everyone has done so, enter/run the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("all_mpg.csv")

dim(mpg)

# Do you like the color "rosy brown"?
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point(color = "rosybrown3")
```

- The `mpg` data should have more than 6 rows again.
- This simple code only worked because everyone put the file in the root folder 
of a project.


## Summary

- Stolen literally right out of our text.
- RStudio projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future.
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project.
- Keep data files there; weâ€™ll talk about loading them into R in data import.
- Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.
- Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.
- Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.

Everything you need is in one place, and cleanly separated from all the other 
projects that you are working on.
