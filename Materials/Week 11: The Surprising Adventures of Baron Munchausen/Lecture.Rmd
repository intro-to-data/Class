- Sampling Theory Primer
    - Create a fake data set.
    - Sample from it - N = 5,10,20,40,80,160,320
    - Standard Deviation and Confidence Intervals
    - Real data is only rarely normal
    - Limitations of confidence intervals on non-normal data
    - Or the silliness of confidence intervals over impossible ranges, etc.
- Bootstrap
    - TODO: Think more about how to introduce this idea.
    - Probably start off comparing it to the sample mean, variance,
      SD, etc.
    - Sampling to achieve a better confidence interval (bootstrap)

# Lab: Pull Yourself Up ....
    - Returning to Open Data New York
    - Use the Analytical template to download a data set
    - Write a script that bootstraps a calculation of a mean and a
      proportion
    - TODO! This needs more work.
