# Lecture
- Yet more data import:
    - Open Data NY (CSV/JSON)
- Logic and flow control structures
    - These are an extension of last week's scripting conversation.
        - Without these, your scripts are very linear.
        - With these - you control the universe.
    - `if()`
    - `ifelse()`
    - `for()`
    - `warning()`
    - `stop()`
    - Example: How to use these: these while importing multiple files
- Writing/using functions
- Exporting Data
    - CSV
    - Excel
    - Rdata
- Simple/Bind
    - `bind_rows()` - Remember your first Homework assignment?, 
    - `bind_cols()` - less frequently useful, but it is used

# Lab: Open Data New York
- This should be a solo lab, based on an Open Data New York data set.
- Students will be asked to use the class template to download
  the data, and then write-up some sort of a simple analysis in R
  Markdown.
- I need to write this lab to focus on EDA.
