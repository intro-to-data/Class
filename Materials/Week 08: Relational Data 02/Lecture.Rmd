# Lab: Exploring Relational Data
- "EDA" on a poorly documented database.
- How do you start? Row Counts!
- How do you figure out what the "unit" of the table is?
- Looking for problems in the data (nulls, strange values, etc.)
- Connect the DB to R and transition from DB-EDA to traditional EDA

- Connect R to Postgres
    - Open / Close a connection
    - Upload a data frame to a table
    - Run a query
    - See list of tables, etc.
    - Demonstrate using scripting to control what happens in a
      reproducible context.
- Write complex queries
    - Andy's process (start with select count(*) from foo;)
