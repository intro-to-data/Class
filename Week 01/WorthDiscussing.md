Please read the attached PDF, from the Washington Post. It describes a
new initiative at Syracuse University to use a phone-app and Bluetooth
sensors to track attendance in class. This article really struck me
because of the following bit:

> And when they skip class? The SpotterEDU app sees that, too, logging
> their absence into acampus database that tracks them over time and can
> sink their grade. It also alerts Rubin,who later contacts students to
> ask where they’ve been. His 340-person lecture has neverbeen so full.

> “They want those points,” he [Professor Rubin] said. “They know I’m

Speaking as a professor, I want you to engage in my class. I am
egotistical enough to think I have something of value to offer you
that might be useful later in life. Participation in this discussion
is, for example, tracked by Canvas. But Professor Rubin highlights an
important point. When people know their performance is being monitored
their behavior changes. Admit it, you would be less likely to read
this article or comment below if I didn't set this to
Complete/Incomplete. But will tracking student attendance or tracking
who does/does not comment on this article result in you learning more?
How do you feel about this policy?

Whatever you feel, please try to remember the following two
facts. This is an excellent example of a process measure, not an
outcome measure. An example of an outcome measure for a class would be
an exam. It purports to assess your mastery of the class material,
which is the goal of any class. Attendance is a process which is
broadly believed to be associated with mastery of class material, but
is not the same. Has anyone ever encountered another process
measurement? Could you describe it? Was it useful?

Please discuss.
