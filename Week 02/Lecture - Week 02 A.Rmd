# Collect It Yourself

## Assignment 01: Collect It Yourself!

1. The class will decide on a survey topic to ask your fellow students.
2. The class will determine how to collect the data, etc.
3. The class will determine what the survey questions are, how to target, etc.
4. The class will determine what demographic features, etc. to include.
5. The class will determine how to determine who to survey, etc.
6. Individually collect 10 rows of survey data.
   - This depends largely on the previous decisions

## Some rules/caveats:

* You must collect data from other students. Not each other.
* Include demographic, or other data which is related to the survey question so
we can stratify results.
* Avoid hot-button topics like politics, etc.
* Each row of submitted data must have a SurveyID.
   * Data collected must be anonymous. 
   * SurveyID:
      * **Example:** Andy Choens -> AC1, AC2 . . . . AC10.
* <span style="color:red">**WARNING:** We will use this data in a later lab.</span>

# Topic Ideas?

## Operationalize

1. ~~The class will decide on a survey topic to ask your fellow students.~~
2. The class will determine how to collect the data, etc.
   - Google Forms?
   - Microsoft Forms?
   - Survey Monkey
3. The class will determine what the survey questions are, how to target, etc.
   - We don't have to do all of this tonight.
4. The class will determine what demographic features, etc. to include.
   - Thoughts?
5. The class will determine how to determine who to survey, etc.
   - Thoughts?
   
This conversation SHOULD continue in the discussion forum.

## Warning: This isn't easy

> The bad news is that when ever you learn a new skill your going to suck. It’s
going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and happens to
everyone and it is only temporary. You can’t go from knowing nothing to becoming
an expert without going through a period of great frustration and great
suckiness.
**Hadley Wickham**

<table><tr><td width="50%">
**Before Spring Break:**

- Import: `read_csv`, `read_excel`, web-scraping, SQL, etc.
- Clean Up: `dplyr`, `tidyr`
- Transform: `dplyr`

**After Spring Break:**

- Model
- Communicate

## R Setup

- This installs the tidyverse for your local user. 
- You need only do this once. This will take a second.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


## R Setup (2)

- Load the tidyverse into your current R session. 
- You must load it in EACH session to use tidyverse functions.
- The `tidyverse` is a metapackage.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
