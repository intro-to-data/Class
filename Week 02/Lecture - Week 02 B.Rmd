## Libraries

```{r}
## If you reset R/RStudio . . . . 
library(tidyverse)
```


## Some Data (1)

- R comes with many datasets built-in.
- This is a data frame, a two-dimensional structure.
- Each column is a vector.
- To learn more about this data set, `?mpg`

```{r}
## The first command _will_ fail if you haven't loaded the tidyverse.
data(mpg)
head(mpg)
```


## Some Data (2)

- We can look at this data in Excel:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## But first we need another package:
install.packages("clipr")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(clipr)
write_clip(mpg)
```

- Now, paste this into Excel (Ctrl+v).
- Can you figure out how to apply a filter to the data?


## Vectors (1)
  
- You can use the `$` operator to access a column.

```{r}
mpg$manufacturer
```


## Vectors (2)

**Filter:**

```{r}
mpg$manufacturer[ mpg$model == "a4" ]
```

**Math:**

```{r}
mean( mpg$cty )
```

## Questions?

- Any questions from the first lab. 
- Any questions from the material we've covered thus far?
- Yes, the meaning of life _is_ 42.

# Stories, From Data

## Data Visualization Skillz!

One of the most important skills you can learn is how to effectively understand
data visually. To do so, you must first understand when to use different kinds
of data visualizations.

[https://www.data-to-viz.com/](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)

You should bookmark this URL. This thing is GREAT.

## Remember the "Class Survey"?

- If you don't, let's think about it some more . . . now.
- Also, I didn't realize I had set so many of the survey questions to have a "right" answer. So, that is awkward.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-data/Lectures/master/Week%2002/awkward.png" align="center" width = "100%">

## What year are you in at ACPHS?

- Select the option that best describes where you are in your educational
journey.
   - 1st Year (Freshman)
   - 2nd Year (Sophmore)
   - 3rd Year (Junior)
   - 4th Year (Senior)
   - 5+ (You like it here)
   - 999 (Grad School)

What would be the best way to show this data?

- As a table?
- As a chart?

## What year are you in at ACPHS? (1)

### Cross tab

```{r}
## Don't worry about the code right now. We will learn how to do this.
## Also, the column names coming out of the Canvas tool are, challenging.
Survey %>% 
  group_by(Year = `What year are you in at ACPHS?\nSelect the option that best describes where you are in your educational journey.`) %>% 
  summarize(N = n()) %>% 
  mutate("%" = round(100*N/sum(N),1))

```


## What year are you in at ACPHS? (2)

### Visualized, Counts

```{r}
## Don't worry about the code right now. We will learn how to do this.
## Also, the column names coming out of the Canvas tool are, challenging.
ggplot(Survey, mapping = aes(x = `What year are you in at ACPHS?\nSelect the option that best describes where you are in your educational journey.`)) +
  labs(y = "Count", x="Year In School") +
  geom_bar(fill="darkred")
```

## What year are you in at ACPHS? (2)

### Visualized, Percent

```{r}
## Don't worry about the code right now. We will learn how to do this.
## Also, the column names coming out of the Canvas tool are, challenging.
ggplot(Survey, mapping = aes(x = `What year are you in at ACPHS?\nSelect the option that best describes where you are in your educational journey.`)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = 100*(..count..)/sum(..count..)), fill="darkred") +
  labs(y = "Percent", x="Year In School") +
  ylim(0,100)
```

## What is your current age? (1)

- Provide an integer answer (no decimals or fractions).

- As a table?
- As a chart?

## What is your current age? (2)

### Cross tab

```{r}
## Don't worry about the code right now. We will learn how to do this.
## Also, the column names coming out of the Canvas tool are, challenging.
Survey %>% 
  group_by("Current Age" = `What is your current age?\nProvide an integer answer (no decimals or fractions).`) %>% 
  summarize(N = n()) %>% 
  mutate("%" = round(100*N/sum(N),1))

```


## What is your current age? (3)

### Visualized, Counts

```{r}
## Don't worry about the code right now. We will learn how to do this.
## Also, the column names coming out of the Canvas tool are, challenging.
ggplot(Survey, mapping = aes(x = `What is your current age?\nProvide an integer answer (no decimals or fractions).`)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="darkred")
```


## What is your current age? (4)

### Visualized, Density

```{r}
## Don't worry about the code right now. We will learn how to do this.
## Also, the column names coming out of the Canvas tool are, challenging.
ggplot(Survey, mapping = aes(x = `What is your current age?\nProvide an integer answer (no decimals or fractions).`)) +
  geom_density(fill="darkred")
```


## What is your current age By Year in School (1)

- What if I wanted to compare (visually) the age of students by their year in
school?
- How could I do that?


## What is your current age By Year in School (2)

### Visualized, Box plot

```{r}
## Don't worry about the code right now. We will learn how to do this.
## Also, the column names coming out of the Canvas tool are, challenging.
ggplot(Survey, mapping = aes(x = factor(`What year are you in at ACPHS?\nSelect the option that best describes where you are in your educational journey.`), y = `What is your current age?\nProvide an integer answer (no decimals or fractions).`)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="darkred") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Year in School", y = "Age In Year")
```


## Graphically Lying

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

- Don't overstate change. This is often done with percentages.

## Load Your library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

- Now that we've thought about the KINDS of graphs we can do, let's actually
draw some.

## Graphing

```{r out.width="60%"}
## This is slightly different from what is shown in the book.
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```

## A Tale of Two Axes

- What do we call the variable on the X Axis?
- What do we call the variable on the Y Axis?
- What are we implying about these two factors?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2)
```


## Bar Graphs (N Count)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
# Note the difference between color and fill.
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = manufacturer)) + 
    geom_bar(fill = "royalblue") +
    labs(x = "Manufacturer", y = "Count") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .45))
```


## Histogram (1)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
# Note the difference between color and fill.
# bins defaults to 30 There is no perfect right answer.
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "darkgreen", color="lightgray", size=1.5)
```

## Histogram (2)

- `geom_histogram` has a variable called `bins`, which sets the number of bars
in the histogram.
- This is different from a bar chart, where the number of bars is determined
on the number of factors in the columns.
- How do we know what to set the bins to?

There are standards:

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width)
- Square-root choice: `r sqrt(length(mpg$cty))`
this case.)
- Sturges' formula (<img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c020d823eb7a197d7db70bc66f8189c2ed7782b8">): `r log2(length(mpg$cty))+1`
- And on, and on, and on.
- With this many standards, you may be forgiven for thinking there is no
standard.
- And you would be right. The question is really this - what are you trying to
show about the distribution of the data?

## Histogram (3)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

sliderInput("n_breaks", "Number of bins:",
              min = 0, max = 100, value = 10, step = 10)

renderPlot({
  ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = input$n_breaks, fill = "darkgreen", color="lightgray", size=1.5)
  })
```

## Density Plot (1)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
## Can I have a round of applause for this color
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty)) + 
    geom_density(fill = "palegreen4", alpha = .5, size=1.5)
```


## Density Plot (2)

- These have a similar "challenge".
- Although they seem simple, the smoothing bandwidth has a similar affect on the
resulting graph.
- However, the "standard" is a bit more of a standard.
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation#A_rule-of-thumb_bandwidth_estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation#A_rule-of-thumb_bandwidth_estimator)


## Density Plot (3)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

sliderInput("bw", "Smoothing Bandwidth:",
              min = 0, max = 2, value = 1, step = .125)

renderPlot({
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty)) + 
        geom_density(fill = "palegreen4", alpha = .5, size=1.5, bw = input$bw)
  })
```


## Scatter Plots

```{r out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "tomato2", size = 2)
```

- It is work revisiting: What is the X-Axis and what is the Y-Axis?

## Regression Line

```{r out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
   geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 2) +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", color="maroon", size = 1.5)
```


## Facets

```{r out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
   geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 2) +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", color="maroon", size = 1.5) +
   facet_wrap(~class, nrow = 2)
```

## Correlation Plot

```{r}
## Slightly tougher
library(GGally)
ggcorr(mpg, label = TRUE)
```

- This was not in the book.
- But it is useful.
- We need to unpack this a little. First, what is this telling us and how might
it be useful?

```{r}
cor(mpg$cty, mpg$hwy)
```
