**Attendance Policy:** I expect you to attend/participate in class and
lab. By doing so, you will learn more. With that said, you are an
adult and I intend to treat you as such. If for some reason you are
unable to attend class notify me as soon as possible and we will work
out how you can complete the necessary assignments.

**Office Hours:** As an adjunct, I dont have an office other than our
classroom and I spend most of my day in Troy, NY at my day job. If
there is something you would like to discuss, contact me via Slack and
we will arrange a time to meet. You are welcome to come out to my
office in Troy where we can meet in a conference room. Alternatively,
I will usually be in the classroom by ~6:00 PM on Thursday nights. If
you tell me ahead of time - I can guarantee I will be in the classroom
by 6:00. I am here to support you. Let me know how I can best do that.

**Inclement Weather:** If the school is closed we will not have
class. If the school is open we will have class. With that said, our
class is at night and I suspect at least some of you live off
campus. If you feel unsafe about traveling before/after our class due
to weather, let me know and we will work something out.

# Course Description / Objectives
> Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific
> methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and
> insights from data in various forms, both structured and
> unstructured,[1][2] similar to data mining.
> 
> Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine
> learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and
> analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It employs techniques and
> theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
> statistics, information science, and computer science.
> 
> Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth
> paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now
> data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing
> because of the impact of information technology" and the data
> deluge.[4][5]
>
> [Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

Topics touched upon in this interdisciplinary course include:

| Computer Science            | Statistics             | Research Fundamentals      |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------|
| Import data                 | Sampling theory        | Develop research questions |
| Review/clean data           | Confidence intervals   | Answer research questions  |
| Manage data                 | Monte Carlo simulation | Research ethics            |
| Generate summary statistics | Machine Learning       |                            |
| Literate programming        |                        |                            |
| Relational data             |                        |                            |

# Prerequisites
This course has a single prerequisite - curiosity. No analyst or
researcher can succeed with out curiosity. Bring it in abundance.

# Textbooks & Software
Out-of-pocket costs for this course are zero. All materials needed to
complete this course are available online, for free. That said, these
materials _are_ very important. Because classroom time is limited,
there will be important material covered in the reading that will not
be covered in-class.

## Textbooks
1. [Hands-On Programming with
   R (HOPR)](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by *Garrett
   Grolemund*
3. [R For Data Science (R4DS)](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by *Hadley Wickham and
   Garrett Grolemund*

There is a dead-tree edition of each text. These cost money, but the
authors have more than earned it. I personally own a copy of
each. However, the online version is identical to the dead-tree
edition and is entirely sufficient for the course.

## Recommended Reading
Specific readings will be assigned from these additional resources:

- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
- [Andrew Gelman's blog: Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/)
- [Frank Harrell's blog: Statistical Thinking](http://www.fharrell.com/)

## Software
The tools used in this class are Free and Open Source Software. We'll
discuss what that means in class, but for now it can simply mean you
don't have to pay anything to use them. The first lab includes time to
install and configure these tools.

Students will use the following software:

| Name             | Recommended Download Link                                                     | License | Cost  |
|:---------        |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------:|:-----:|
| R                | [Download R - CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)                              | GPL  v2 | $0.00 |
| R Studio         | [Download RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop) | AGPL v3 | $0.00 |
|Excel/LibreOffice | [Download LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)        | MPL  v2 | $0.00 |

Students may use other R IDEs such as Emacs ESS, but classroom
examples will focus on RStudio. Students may use either Microsoft
Excel or LibreOffice Calc for spreadsheet assignments/projects (or
other compatible software).

# Assignments & Grading

The lab portion of the class will be graded separately from the class.

| Assignments         | Assign Date | Due Date   | % Final Grade    |

: Intro to Data Assignments

There will be one lab per week, except Week 8 (2019-03-07) and on the
day of the final exam (2019-05-02). Each lab will be equally weighted.

| Grade Letter | Numeric Score | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                 |

| A            |            95 | Your lab notebook contains complete, correct, and throughtful answers for all questions. It is evident you are completing the reading and learning the material.         |
| B            |            85 | Your lab notebook contains a mostly complete, correct, and relevant answers for most questions. It is apparent you are completing the reading and learning the material. |
| C            |            75 | Your lab notebook is incomplete or contains consistent errors. It is not apparent you are completing the reading and learning the material.                              |
| D            |            65 | Your lab notebook is incomplete or contains consistent errors. This is like a C but "more so". Are you completing the assigned reading? We should talk.                  |
| F            |            55 | Your lab notebook demonstrates that you are not completing the readings and/or understanding the material. We should talk, soon.                                         |
| NA           |            00 | You failed to complete and/or submit the lab. We should talk about your future in this class immediately.                                                                |
:Lab Grade Criteria

# Tentative Lecture Plan
`PBH210` is a class. `PBH211` is a lab. Programming and working with data
are skills best learned by asking lots of questions and engaging in
the practice. There is a lecture component of this class. You will get
more out of it if you are engaged. If you don't understand - tell me.

The subject matter see in the lab will built upon what we learned
during the lecture portion of our evening. With the exception of Week
08 (Midterm) students are permitted to discuss their labs with others
in the class, ask for help on Slack, etc. That said - what you submit
should be YOUR work.

**Students are expected to complete all class readings.** I cannot
stress this enough. Most of you, I assume, are not programmers. There
is going to be a learning curve. If class is the first time you
encounter a concept - you won't learn this material.
