```{r}
## INIT ========================================================================
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen=999)


## VARS ========================================================================
data_file <- "./new-york-city-airbnb-open-data.zip"


## DATA ========================================================================
Airbnb <- read_csv(data_file)
Airbnb
```


Blah blah blah

```{r}
ggplot(Airbnb, aes(price)) + geom_density()
```

# Analysis: Cost Per Neighbourhood

Here is your analysis of cost per Neighbourhood:

```{r}
Airbnb %>%
    group_by(Neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>%
    summarize("Avg Price" = mean(price),
              "Min Price"  = min(price),
              "Max Price"  = max(price))
```
