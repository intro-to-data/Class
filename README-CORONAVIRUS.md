## Software
The tools used in this class are Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS). We'll discuss what that means in class, but for now it can
simply mean you don't have to pay anything to use them. The first lab
includes time to install and configure these tools.

Students will use the following software:

## PBH 211 Intro To Data Lab
Each lab builds on the content of that weeks lecture. Thus, each lab
is assigned on the day of the lecture and is due the day before the
next lecture. Because I recognize that things happen and that this is
a lot to learn in a short amount of time, I will drop your lowest lab
grade. But, be aware that you are still responsible for the material
on that lab for the midterm/final exam.
