**Attendance Policy:** I expect you to attend/participate in class and
lab. By doing so, you will learn more. With that said, you are an
adult and I intend to treat you as such. If for some reason you are
unable to attend class notify me as soon as possible and we will work
out how you can complete the necessary assignments.

**Office Hours:** As an adjunct, I dont have an office other than our
classroom/lab and I spend most of my day in Troy, NY at my day job. If
there is something you would like to discuss, contact me via Slack and
we will arrange a time to meet. You are welcome to come out to my
office in Troy where we can meet in a conference room. Alternatively,
I will usually be in the classroom by ~6:00 PM on Thursday nights. If
you tell me ahead of time - I can guarantee I will be in the classroom
by 6:00. I am here to support you. Let me know how I can best do that.

**Inclement Weather:** If the school is closed we will not have
class. If the school is open we will have class. With that said, our
class is at night and I suspect at least some of you live off
campus. If you feel unsafe about traveling before/after our class due
to weather, let me know and we will work something out.

# Course Description / Objectives
> Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific
> methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and
> insights from data in various forms, both structured and
> unstructured,[1][2] similar to data mining.
> 
> Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine
> learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and
> analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It employs techniques and
> theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
> statistics, information science, and computer science.
> 
> Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth
> paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now
> data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing
> because of the impact of information technology" and the data
> deluge.[4][5]
>
> [Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

Topics touched upon in this interdisciplinary course include:

The Intro To Data course breaks down into roughly two halves. The
first half of the course, which ends roughly when you go off for
Spring Break, is focused on data manipulation. That is, the science of
importing, managing, and describing your data. After you get back
refreshed and renewed from Spring Break, we will spend some time
thinking about regression (linear and logistic) and comparisons (the
dreaded p-value).Â 

# Prerequisites
This course has a single prerequisite - curiosity. No analyst or
researcher can succeed with out curiosity. Bring it in abundance.

# Textbooks & Software
Out-of-pocket costs for this course are zero. All materials needed to
complete this course are available online, for free. That said, these
materials _are_ very important. Because classroom time is limited,
there will be important material covered in the reading that will not
be covered in-class.

## Textbooks
1. [R For Data Science (R4DS)](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by *Hadley Wickham and
   Garrett Grolemund*
2. Additional assigned readings, videos, etc.

There is a dead-tree edition of the primary text. Although it does
cost money, the authors have earned it. I personally own a copy of
each. However, the online edition has everything you need for
class. Purchasing the dead-tree edition is optional.

## Recommended Reading
Specific readings will be assigned from these additional resources:

- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
- [Andrew Gelman's blog: Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/)
- [Frank Harrell's blog: Statistical Thinking](http://www.fharrell.com/)

## Software
The tools used in this class are Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS). We'll discuss what that means in class, but for now it can
simply mean you don't have to pay anything to use them. The first lab
includes time to install and configure these tools.

Students will use the following software:

| Name             | Recommended Download Link                                                     | License | Cost  |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------:|:-----:|
| R                | [Download R - CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)                              | GPL  v2 | $0.00 |
| R Studio         | [Download RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop) | AGPL v3 | $0.00 |
|Excel/LibreOffice | [Download LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)        | MPL  v2 | $0.00 |

Students may use other R IDEs such as Emacs ESS, but classroom
examples will focus on RStudio. Students may use either Microsoft
Excel or LibreOffice Calc for spreadsheet assignments/projects (or
other compatible software).

# Assignments & Grading
Although taught together, the lab portion of the course (PBH211) will
be graded separately from the class.

: Intro to Data Assignments

Throughout the course I have a series of planned discussion I am
calling "Worth Discussing". These are articles, often from a newspaper
such as the Washington Post or Ars Technica which highlight something
interesting that I would challenge you to think about. There is no
single right or wrong answer to these discussions, but they are
important nonetheless.

- Assignment 01: Collect it yourself!
- Assignment 02: How will data affect your life?
- Assignment 03: Reproducibility & Replicability
- Assignment 04: Crisis

Assignment details are available on Canvas.

## PBH 211 Intro To Data Lab
Each lab builds on the content of that weeks lecture. Thus, each lab
is assigned on the day of the lecture and is due the day before the
next lecture. Because I recognize that things happen and that this is
a lot to learn in a short amount of time, I will drop your lowest lab
grade. But, be aware that you are still responsible for the material
on that lab for the midterm/final exam.

:Lab Grade Criteria

# Tentative Lecture Plan
`PBH210` is a class. `PBH211` is a lab. Programming and working with data
are skills best learned by asking lots of questions and engaging in
the practice. There is a lecture component of this class. You will get
more out of it if you are engaged. If you don't understand, tell me.

Each week's lab will build upon what we learned during the
lecture. Students are permitted to discuss their labs with others in
the class, discuss on Canvas, etc. That said - what you submit should
be YOUR work.

**Students are expected to complete all class readings.** I cannot
stress this enough. Most of you, I assume, are not programmers. There
is going to be a learning curve. If class is the first time you
encounter a concept, you won't learn this material.
